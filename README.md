## TODO NEXT
- [x] Make the game page with user stats and game
- [ ] When implementing the leaderboard make it possible to click on an entry and view more. Make the animation with framer-motion like the example in the front page
- [ ] Make it so when the user closes the page, the game is automatically finished, to prevent extremely long game times.
