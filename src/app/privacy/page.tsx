        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to our website, applications, products,

        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <h3>Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          When you use our Services, we may collect Personal Data, which refers
          to any information that identifies you personally. This includes, but
          is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact information such as your name and email address.</li>
          <li>IP address and other network identifiers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Non-Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          We may also collect non-personal data, which is data that cannot be
          directly linked to an individual. This includes browser and device
          information, application usage data, and anonymous demographic
          information.
        </p>

        <h3>Use of Information</h3>
        <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving our Services.</li>
          <li>Responding to user inquiries and providing customer support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We may share your personal information with third parties under the
          following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>With your consent.</li>
          <li>
            With third-party vendors and other service providers that perform
            services on our behalf.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with relevant laws,
            to respond to legal requests, or to protect our rights, property, or
            safety.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We do not use cookies to collect information, except for
          authentication purposes. We only use analytics to collect anonymous
          demographic information, such as user counts and general geographic
          location by country. We may also collect your IP address and other
          network identifiers automatically when you interact with our Services
          for purposes such as authentication, security, fraud prevention,
          logging, and basic geolocation. IP addresses can in some circumstances
          be personal data under applicable laws; when they are, we treat them
          in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We employ reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures
          designed to safeguard the information we collect. However, no security
          measure is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security
          of your information. We may process IP addresses and related logs to
          help detect and prevent abuse, unauthorized access, and other security
          incidents.
        </p>

        <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Personal information that you submit through the Services may be
          transferred to countries outside your own, such as servers in the U.S.
          or the EU, depending on our hosting providers. We do not control the
          location of servers, and your personal information may be subject to
          privacy laws that differ from those in your country. This may include
          any IP addresses and network identifiers collected in connection with
          your use of the Services.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your
          personal information. These rights can include accessing your data,
          modifying it, and requesting deletion.
        </p>

        <h2>Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our Services are not directed to individuals under 13. We do not
          knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we
          become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal
